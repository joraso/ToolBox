# ToolBox

This project is intended to be a collection of mostly independent functions and tools for data analysis, data science as well as general algorithms and computer science, built for my own education and for potential rapid deployment of tools to projects I may undertake in the future. It also serves as a sort of notebook for me, as I acquire new computational skills, and codify the techniques I already know.

Currently included is:
- Principal Component Analysis
- Classification DNN
- Binary Tree Structure/Algorithms

Planned inclusions are:
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Autoincoders (possibly variational)
- Support vector machines / classic ML methods
- Multidimensional Linear Regression
- Monte Carlo optimization
- Gradient Descent optimization (normal and stochastic)
