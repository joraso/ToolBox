# ToolBox

This repository is intended to be a personal notebook of numerical analysis, applied math, and algorithmic pregramming methods --- a place to stash my notes and code for new methods as I acquire them and techniques I already know as I review them.

## Mathematics
This folder is dedicated to applied math and numerical analysis methods.

#### Currently included:
- Principal Component Analysis

#### Planned inclusions:
- Singular value decomposition
- Numerical Calculus
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Multidimensional Linear Regression
- Monte Carlo optimization
- Gradient Descent (normal and stochastic)

## Coding
This folder is dedicated to algorithmic programming examples and practice.

#### Currently included:
- Binary Tree structure/algorithms
- Singly Linked List structure/algorithms
- Sorting algorithms (merge/quick sort) 
- Miscellaneous coding problems
