# ToolBox

This repository is intended to be a collection of general numerical analysis, applied math, computer science algorithms and methods. These are mostly for my own education, as a place to stach new computational/applied math methods I learn and codify the techniques I already know.

### Currently included:
- Principal Component Analysis
- Binary Tree Structure/Algorithms

### Planned inclusions:
- Numerical Calculus
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Multidimensional Linear Regression
- Monte Carlo optimization
- Gradient Descent (normal and stochastic)
