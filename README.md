# ToolBox

This repository is intended to be a personal notebook of numerical analysis, applied math, and algorithmic pregramming methods --- a place to stash my notes and code for new methods as I acquire them and techniques I already know as I review them.

## Mathematics
This folder is dedicated to applied math and numerical analysis methods.

#### Currently included:
- Principal Component Analysis

#### Planned inclusions:
- Singular value decomposition
- Numerical Calculus
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Multidimensional Linear Regression
- Monte Carlo optimization
- Gradient Descent (normal and stochastic)

## Coding
This folder is dedicated to algorithmic programming examples and practice.

#### Currently included:
- Binary Tree structure/algorithms
- Singly Linked List structure/algorithms
- Sorting algorithms (merge/quick sort)
- Searching algorithms (binary search)
- Graph structure/algorithms
- Miscellaneous interesting/hard coding problems

## Python
This folder is dedicated to notes and snippits specific to Python usage.

#### Currently incuded:
- Example of an overloading operators for a custom object.
- Sample usage of decorators, with an example timer, log and repeater decorators.
- Basic creation/usage of a generator, with Fibonacci number example.
- Basic creation/usage of a context manager.

## PyQt
PyQt practice and examples.

#### Currently incuded:
- A simple "Hello World" popup, demonstrating very basic usage.
- A True/False popup quiz with rudimentary layouts, buttons, and simple signal/slot usage.
- A simple calculator app with grid layout and line edit usage.
- A simple list maker widget, demonstrating the basic model/viewer architecture paradigm.
- A more complex CSV viewer/editor project (currently under construction), making use of QTables, QFileDialog, QTabWidget, QMainWindow, and QToolBar.
