# ToolBox

This project is intended to be a collection of mostly independent functions and tools for data analysis and data science, built for my own education and for potential rapid deployment of tools to projects I may undertake in the future. It also serves as a sort of notebook for me, as I aqcuire new data science skills, and codify the techniques I already know.

Planned inclusions are:
- Principal Component Analysis
- Multidimensional Linear Regression
- Monte Carlo optimization
- Gradient Descent (normal and stochastic)
